    "I'm not saying your code is bad, but even the compiler is asking for a break.",
    "The real problem with writing code is not that it's difficult; it's that you think it’s easy until you try to debug it.",
    "Why do programmers prefer dark mode? Because the bugs are less visible in the dark.",
    "There are only two hard things in programming: cache invalidation and naming things. Oh, and debugging your code while you're at it.",
    "I think you might be overthinking your code... but then again, I also overthink everything.",
    "A programmer’s life: It works on my machine, but will it work on your machine? Let’s find out in production.",
    "You know you're a programmer when you have to explain why your code 'just works' to non-tech people who won't get it.",
    "How do programmers solve problems? They don't, they just add more comments until they become a feature.",
    "If debugging is the process of removing bugs, then programming must be the process of putting them in.",
    "Real programmers don't debug, they just write new features to 'fix' the old ones.",
    "A program is never finished until the boss says it's finished... even if there are still bugs.",
    "Programmers: Making problems disappear since the dawn of time, only to create more complicated ones in their place.",
    "If at first you don't succeed, call it version 1.0.",
    "You know you're a programmer when your 'hello world' is more complicated than your actual project.",
    "A programmer’s favorite exercise: 'One more feature, then I’ll go to bed... 3 AM hits'.",
    "Real programmers don't use breakpoints, they just write 'console.log('debugging')' and call it a day.",
    "Why do programmers prefer iOS development? Because they don't like Android 'bugs'.",
    "A code walk-through is just an opportunity to explain why you left 50 comments in your code. Or was it 100?",
    "Every programmer has their own version of 'it works on my machine'. It's not a bug, it's a feature!",
    "The only time a programmer's life is truly organized is when they create a method to sort their laundry.",
    "Why was the JavaScript developer sad? Because he didn't 'null' his feelings.",
    "If code is art, then my comments are poetry. Just trying to find a rhyme for 'undefined'.",
    "The ‘Hello, World!’ program is a lie. It’s never just 'hello'. There are always dependencies to install first.",
    "A programmer's life: Write code, ship code, break something, debug, repeat. It’s like a never-ending cycle of self-inflicted pain.",
    "When debugging, just remember: If you're not crying, you're not trying hard enough.",
    "Programmers are just like magicians. You see them making stuff appear out of nowhere... until you look at the stack trace.",
    "The best way to avoid bugs is to program with your eyes closed. It’s not guaranteed, but at least it’s fun!",
    "I’m not a magician, but I can turn coffee into code (and occasionally bugs).",
    "You can’t spell 'debugging' without 'debug'. Actually, you can, but you probably shouldn’t.",
    "Why do Java developers wear glasses? Because they don’t see sharp.",
    "My code works perfectly... as long as you never run it in production.",
    "Programming is like a relationship. If it’s hard to explain, then you probably shouldn’t be doing it.",
    "Never trust a programmer who says, 'It works perfectly fine, I swear'. They’re probably lying or running tests in the wrong environment.",
    "When in doubt, add more logs. Debugging is like looking for a needle in a haystack, but with enough logs, you can at least make the haystack bigger.",
    "I’ve learned that programming is 99% problem-solving and 1% Googling solutions to problems you didn’t think you’d have.",
    "To the guy who asked, 'Can you just write some code for me?' — Yes, but I’ll need coffee, snacks, and a motivational speech."
